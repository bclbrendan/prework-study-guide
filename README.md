 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This is a pre work guide to ensure I am remembering the main points of the prework. This gives me an easy to read version of the information in a presentable appearance. 
When I am unable to remember certain points learned in the prework I can easily find them.
I learned how to write basic HTML, CSS and javascript 





## Usage

You can read through the different sections of the webpage to explain how to code HTML, CSS javascript and Git.
